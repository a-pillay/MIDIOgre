MIDIOgre is a powerful Python library for performing data augmentations on MIDI inputs, primarily designed for machine learning models operating on symbolic music data. With MIDIOgre, you can easily generate variations of MIDI sequences to enrich your training data and improve the robustness and generalization of your models.

While inspired by the functionalities of existing libraries like [mdtk](https://github.com/JamesOwers/midi_degradation_toolkit) and [miditok](https://miditok.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.1/data_augmentation.html), MIDIOgre offers _on-the-fly_ augmentation similar to [albumentation](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations) and [audiomentation](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations), generating randomly modified MIDI data directly in RAM to enable extensive augmentation with minimal memory overhead.

## Features

- **Comprehensive MIDI Augmentations**: A wide range of transformations including pitch shifting, onset time modification, duration changes, and more
- **Easy Integration**: API design follows [PyTorch augmentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/transforms.html) scheme to integrate seamlessly with machine learning workflows 
- **Customizable**: Flexible parameters for fine-tuning augmentations to your needs
- **Efficient**: Optimized for handling large MIDI datasets

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install midiogre
```

The following scenarios will require the development version of `pretty-midi` from GitHub:
- When using `TempoShift` followed by other MIDIOgre augmentations in a `Compose` pipeline
- This is because `TempoShift` returns a `mido.MidiFile` object that needs to be converted back to a `pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI` object

If you need this functionality, install the development version of `pretty-midi`:
```bash
pip install "pretty-midi @ git+https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi"
```

If you encounter any installation issues, try upgrading pip first:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Install from source (for development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/a-pillay/MIDIOgre.git
cd MIDIOgre

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Documentation

The complete documentation for MIDIOgre is available online at [https://a-pillay.github.io/MIDIOgre/](https://a-pillay.github.io/MIDIOgre/). The documentation includes:
- Detailed API reference
- Usage examples
- Tutorials
- Best practices
- Development guidelines

## Quick Start

```python
from midiogre.augmentations import PitchShift, OnsetTimeShift, NoteDelete
from midiogre.core import Compose
import pretty_midi

# Basic usage - single file augmentation
midi_data = pretty_midi.PrettyMIDI('input.mid')
transform = Compose([
    PitchShift(max_shift=3, mode='both', p=0.8),
    OnsetTimeShift(max_shift=0.1, mode='both', p=0.5)
])
augmented = transform(midi_data)
augmented.write('output.mid')

# Integration with ML pipelines
class MIDIDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Your MIDI loading logic here
        midi_data = load_midi(idx)
        return self.transform(midi_data) if self.transform else midi_data

# Define augmentation pipeline for training
transform = Compose([
    PitchShift(max_shift=3, mode='both', p=0.8),      # Randomly transpose by ±3 semitones
    OnsetTimeShift(max_shift=0.1, mode='both', p=0.5), # Shift note timings by up to 100ms
    NoteDelete(p=0.3)                                  # Randomly remove up to 30% of notes
])

# Use in your training pipeline
train_dataset = MIDIDataset(transform=transform)
val_dataset = MIDIDataset(transform=None)  # No augmentation for validation
```

## Available Augmentations

### Currently Implemented

- **PitchShift**: Transpose MIDI note values of selected instruments
- **OnsetTimeShift**: Modify note onset times while preserving durations
- **DurationShift**: Alter note durations while maintaining onset times
- **NoteDelete**: Remove notes from instrument tracks
- **NoteAdd**: Add new notes to instrument tracks
- **TempoShift**: Modify the global tempo of MIDI files

### Planned Features

- **NoteSplit**: Split notes into multiple segments
- **VelocityShift**: Modify MIDI note velocities
- Swing-based augmentations
- MIDI CC based augmentations
- Semantically-meaningful augmentations (respecting rhythms & beats)

## Development

Please note that this project is developed with the assistance of [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), mostly for runtime optimizations, unit-testing, documentation and build pipelines.

### Setting up for development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install documentation dependencies (if working on docs)
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
# For coverage report
pytest --cov=midiogre tests/
```

### Versioning

MIDIOgre uses [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) for versioning based on git tags:

- **Release versions** (e.g., `vX.Y.Z`): Created from git tags. To create a new release:
  ```bash
  git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
  git push origin vX.Y.Z
  ```
  This will trigger the release workflow and publish to PyPI with version `X.Y.Z.post0`.

- **Development versions** (e.g., `vX.Y.Z.postN`): Automatically generated for commits to the main branch.
  These are also published to PyPI but marked as development releases.
